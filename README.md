### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States of Americaâ€”Chicago, Washington and New York City. This code is written using python to ask questions on the data and derive answers using<b>descriptive statistics</b>. I also provide an interactive shell to take in user input and human readable responses when necessary.

The datasets used in this project is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US and it contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The dataset for each city are identical in that they contain the same set of columns we use in our analysis, 

Through writing code, I'm able to answer the following questions about the bike share data:

- What month occurs most often in the start time?
- What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time? 
- What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
- What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
- What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
- What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of gender?
- What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
